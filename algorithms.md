## Algorithm Characteristics

### Complexity
**Space Complexity**: memory requirements
**Time Complexity**: time requirements

### Inputs and Outputs
An algorithm accepts certain inputs and outputs certain results.

## Common Algorithms
- Search
- Sort
- Computation:
- collection: manipulate or navigate

## Measuring Performance
We use the term Big O because it refers to "order of operation." In order of complexity:
o(1): constant time
o(log n): logarithmic time
o(n) linear time
o(n log n) log linear time
o(n*n) quadratic time



| Notation | Description | Example | 
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| o(1) | Constant Time | Look up an element in array by index |
| o(log n) | Logarithmic Time | Find element in sorted array with binary search |
| o(n) | Linear Time | search an unsorted array for a value | 
| o(n log n) | log linear time | complex sorting like heap sort or merge sort |
| o(n * n) | quadratic time | sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, etc |
