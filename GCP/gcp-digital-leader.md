## Setting up a GCP Environment

- Create Projects
- Manage Users
- Enable APIs
- Manage Billing

### Permissions
Best practice: create "roles" with defined permissions and then assign them to users. 

There are three types of roles, but we recommend just two, Predefined or Custom. 
- Basic tends to give too many or too few permissions. They include Browser, Viewer, Editor, and Owner, so not great for production. 
- Predefined roles provide smaller sets of permissions for specific resources. 
- Custom roles

Best practice: always give the fewest permissions as you can.

### Billing
