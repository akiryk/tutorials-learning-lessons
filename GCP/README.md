# Google Cloud Engineer Certification

This program consists of the [Google/PluralSite curriculum](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/cloud-engineering-with-google-cloud) and/or the [specialized curriculum](https://app.pluralsight.com/channels/details/1b0cc7b3-4ab1-49a4-ad6d-23f827d40996) designed at wayfair. 

The course structure is based on how Google thinks you should prepare. There's a [diagnostic course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/preparing-associate-cloud-engineer-journey), which helps you plan study steps, and you're supposed to take it first. I suggest taking it last or close to last as a way to identify where you need to go back and study. This is the [set of links](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/cloud-engineering-with-google-cloud) to courses.
