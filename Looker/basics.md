# Looker Intro

## Measures

Looker Measures are an aggregation of one or more dimensions (or unique attributes of the data). Measures let you calculate your Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and help you analyze your data using different attributes.

## Dimensions

Dimensions are unique attributes of the data that helps you describe the data. For example, in the Airports explore, the location of the airport, city, elevation levels, etc., are different dimensions. You can use both Dimensions and Measures in Looker to slice and dice your data to achieve data insights.
