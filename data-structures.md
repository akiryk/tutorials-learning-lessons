### Numerical types in Java

Whole numbers: int, short, long
Decimals: double, float
Float is more performant, but gives a smaller range.

When we say a language represents `int` values with 32 bits, we mean that every <code>int</code> will have 32 1s and 0s. For example:
<code>00000000000000000000000000000011</code> represents 3. In Java, a double is 64 bits.
