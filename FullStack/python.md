# Python

## Guiding principles
- Beautiful is better than ugly
- explicit better than implicit
- simple better than complex
- complex better than making it complicated
- readability counts

Everything is an object.

## `#!`
The shebang, `#!`, is common in unix-based systems. 
It must be the first two characters on the first line of the file, no lines/spaces before. After it is the path to the executable -- such as path to the python interpreter.
