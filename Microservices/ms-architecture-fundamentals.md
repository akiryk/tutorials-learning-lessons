## Introducing Microservices
Review the pros and cons of microservices approach vs monolith approach.

The problem with monoliths in a nutshell:

Monolith: all code is in a single codebase with a single database and a single programming language
- simple
- easy to update

but...
- hard to scale
- accumulation of tech debt
- modules tend to become entangled, lots of coupling
- deployments are harder, take longer
- hard to scale horizontally (more servers); you need to scale vertically (get a better server)
- wedded to legacy technology; hard to transition because of so many dependencies
-
